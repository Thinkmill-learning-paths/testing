# Testing in JavaScript

## Unit Tests

Unit tests is a way of testing individual units like functions or classes by supplying input and making sure the output is as expected. Here we going to use a framework called [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest)

Jest is a fully featured testing framework with a developer experience that is second to none. Itâ€™s remarkably simple and flexible at the same time. For simple use cases, you often donâ€™t need to configure anything, install and enjoy the built-in coverage and watch mode support.

#### Step 01 - Setup Jest

Create a folder and start a new project using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/creating-a-project/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init).

Then install and setup [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)

#### Step 02 - Testing Pure Functions

A pure function must only operate on the input it is given and nothing else. That function must return the output of that operation. Additionally, it doesnâ€™t perform any side effects (usually I/O).

These functions are easy to reason about. They are also easy to test because they donâ€™t require any test doubles. Let's pratice by creating an authentication file and add a function to check what time of password is allowed.

Create a file `password.js`, add the follow `isPasswordAllowed` function, export the function and create another file, `password.test.js` with unit tests. Then try to refactor it, if possible.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: place code as close to where it's relevant as possible.

```js
//password.js
function isPasswordAllowed(password) {
  return password.length > 6 && /\d/.test(password) && /\D/.test(password)
}
```

```js
//password.test.js
import { isPasswordAllowed } from '../auth';

test('isPasswordAllowed only allows some passwords', () => {
    // Write your tests here
})
```

**Bonus01:** Try to refactor your test using [describe](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#describename-fn), create and array with `allowedPasswords` and `disallowedPasswords` and add more tests.

**Bonus02:** Impletement an algorithm to solve the [FizzBuzz](./fizz-buzz) problem and write unit tests for your solution.

#### Step 03 - Testing Functions with Side Effects

A thumb war is a game played by two players in which the thumbs are used to simulate fighting. Check out the implementation in JavaScript for this game at the [Thumb War folder](./thumb-war) and create unit tests.

ðŸ’¡ Hint: Have a look at [Mock Functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api#mockfnmockcalls) and [spyOn](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname).

**Bonus02:** Create unit tests for an algorithm that clean profanity words from any text file and saves as a new and clean file to the system using node. Go to [Swear Words](./swear-words)

#### Step 04 - Testing Functions in a Composition
